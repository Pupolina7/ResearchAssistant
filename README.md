### AI-Powered Academic Research Assistant
**AI-Powered Academic Research Assistant** aims to help students and researchers with writing academic works. The app is an online chat-bot which processes users requests calling the *LLM*. 

The app uses RAG system which is a vector database consisting of different academic works chosen as a knowledge base for the LLM. It also will use routing approach to optimise the performance. The front-end part will be implemented using *Gradio API*(spaces on Huggin Face). 

The following functional will be implemented behind the app:
- Academic style check
- Grammatical analysis
- Research summary
- Writing a research/part of a research (abstract, introduction, methodology, etc.)
- Giving hints for the improvement of the research
- Maybe some other functions will come up during the implementation phase.
